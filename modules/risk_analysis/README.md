# AgroSmartRisk Risk Analysis Module
## Standalone Agricultural Risk Analysis Tool

### Overview

The AgroSmartRisk Risk Analysis Module is a standalone solution for analyzing agricultural risk data. This module can be integrated with the main AgroSmartRisk platform or used independently to provide advanced risk analysis capabilities for agricultural applications.

The module provides farmers, insurers, and agricultural stakeholders with powerful tools to:

1. Visualize risk data over time
2. Analyze trends in agricultural risks
3. Compare different risk factors
4. Forecast future risk levels
5. Analyze seasonal patterns in risk data
6. Correlate weather data with risk factors

### Architecture

The proof-of-concept follows a modern web application architecture:

- **Backend**: Python Flask application with SQLite database

- Confidence intervals for predictions
- Risk change analysis

#### 5. Seasonal Analysis

The seasonal analysis feature identifies patterns related to seasons:
- Monthly risk averages
- Seasonal risk averages
- Identification of highest risk months and seasons
- Seasonal decomposition of time series

#### 6. Weather Correlation

The weather correlation feature analyzes relationships between weather and risk:
- Correlation between weather factors and risk levels
- Identification of most influential weather factors

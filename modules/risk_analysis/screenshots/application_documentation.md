- **Search Button**: Button to apply filters and analyze data

### Analysis Tabs
The application includes six analysis tabs:

1. **Time Series**: Basic visualization of risk over time
2. **Trend Analysis**: Identification of increasing/decreasing trends
3. **Risk Comparison**: Comparison of different risk factors
4. **Forecast**: Prediction of future risk levels
5. **Seasonal Analysis**: Monthly and seasonal risk patterns
6. **Weather Correlation**: Relationship between weather and risk

## Feature Descriptions

### 1. Time Series Visualization

The Time Series tab displays risk data over time with the following features:
- Interactive line chart showing risk levels from 0 to 1
- Color-coded risk zones (low: 0-0.3, medium: 0.3-0.7, high: 0.7-1.0)
- Zoom and pan controls for exploring data
- Date range selector for quick time period selection
- Hover information showing exact risk values on specific dates
- Download button for saving the chart as an image

**How it would look:**
- A line chart with dates on the x-axis and risk levels (0-1) on the y-axis
- The selected risk type (e.g., drought) shown as a colored line
- Background shading indicating risk zones (green for low, yellow for medium, red for high)

### 2. Trend Analysis

The Trend Analysis tab helps identify long-term trends in risk data:
- Raw risk data shown as dots
- Moving average line for smoothing short-term fluctuations
- Trend line showing the overall direction
- Window size selector for adjusting the moving average period
- Trend metrics displayed below the chart:
  - Trend Direction (increasing/decreasing/stable)
  - Trend Strength (numerical value and qualitative assessment)
  - Confidence (RÂ² value and qualitative assessment)

**How it would look:**
- A chart with three lines: raw data (dotted), moving average (solid), and trend line (dashed)
- Three cards below showing trend metrics with color-coding (red for increasing risk, green for decreasing risk)

### 3. Risk Comparison

The Risk Comparison tab allows comparison of different risk factors:
- Multi-line chart showing all risk types simultaneously
- Color-coding to distinguish between risk types
- Correlation table showing relationships between risk factors
- Highlighting of strongest correlations

**How it would look:**
- A line chart with multiple colored lines representing different risk types
- A correlation matrix table below showing numerical correlation values
- Color-coded cells in the table (blue for positive correlations, red for negative)

### 4. Risk Forecasting

The Forecasting tab predicts future risk levels:
- Historical data shown as a solid line
- Forecast shown as a dashed line
- Vertical line indicating the forecast start point
- Forecast period selector (7, 14, 30, or 90 days)
- Risk metrics displayed below the chart:
  - Current Risk Level (with badge and numerical value)
  - Forecasted Risk Level (with badge and numerical value)
  - Risk Change (with color-coding for increasing/decreasing risk)

**How it would look:**
- A chart with historical data and forecast lines
- A vertical dashed line separating historical data from forecast
- Three cards below showing risk metrics with appropriate color-coding

### 5. Seasonal Analysis

The Seasonal Analysis tab identifies patterns related to seasons:
- Bar chart showing monthly risk averages
- Bar chart showing seasonal risk averages (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall)
- Color-coding for seasons
- Highest risk month and season highlighted
- Risk metrics displayed below the charts:
  - Highest Risk Month (with badge and numerical value)
  - Highest Risk Season (with badge and numerical value)

**How it would look:**
- Two bar charts side by side (monthly and seasonal)
- Bars colored according to risk level or season
- Two cards below showing highest risk periods

### 6. Weather Correlation

The Weather Correlation tab analyzes relationships between weather and risk:
- Bar chart showing correlation coefficients for different weather factors
- Color-coding (blue for positive correlations, red for negative)
- Horizontal lines indicating strong correlation thresholds
- Weather correlation metrics displayed below the chart:
  - Most Influential Weather Factor
  - Correlation Strength (with numerical value and qualitative assessment)

**How it would look:**
- A bar chart with weather factors on the x-axis and correlation values (-1 to 1) on the y-axis
- Bars colored blue or red depending on correlation direction
- Two cards below showing the most influential factor and correlation strength

## How to Use the Application

1. **Select a Parcel**:
   - Click the parcel dropdown in the filter panel
   - Choose a parcel from the list (e.g., "Parcel 1 (Corn)")

2. **Choose a Risk Type**:
   - Click the risk type dropdown
   - Select from overall, drought, flood, frost, or pest risk

3. **Set Date Range** (optional):
   - Click the start date input to select a start date
   - Click the end date input to select an end date

4. **Analyze Data**:
   - Click the search button (magnifying glass icon)
   - The application will load data for the selected parcel and risk type

5. **Explore Analysis Tabs**:
   - Click on different tabs to view various analyses
   - Interact with charts by hovering, zooming, and panning
   - Use tab-specific controls (e.g., window size, forecast days)

6. **Download Charts**:
   - Click the download button on any chart to save it as an image

## Sample Data

The application includes sample data for demonstration purposes:

- **Parcels**: 5 sample parcels with different crops and locations
- **Risk Data**: 365 days of historical risk data with seasonal patterns
- **Weather Data**: Corresponding weather data with seasonal variations
- **Risk Events**: Simulated high-risk events

The sample data includes realistic seasonal patterns:
- Drought risk: Higher in summer
- Flood risk: Higher in spring
- Frost risk: Higher in winter
- Pest risk: Higher in late spring/early summer

## Technical Implementation

The proof-of-concept is implemented using:

- **Backend**: Python Flask application with SQLite database
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Bootstrap and Plotly.js
- **Data Analysis**: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and statsmodels libraries
- **Visualization**: Plotly.js for interactive charts

The application follows a modular architecture with separate components for:
- Database models and schema
- API endpoints
- Time series analysis algorithms
- Data visualization
- User interface

## Conclusion

This visual documentation provides an overview of the AgroSmartRisk Time-Series Analysis Module proof-of-concept. The application demonstrates powerful time-series analysis capabilities for agricultural risk data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions about risk management and insurance.

The implementation showcases the technical feasibility of the module and provides a foundation for the full implementation of the AgroSmartRisk platform as outlined in the development plan.
